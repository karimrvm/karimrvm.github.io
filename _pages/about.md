I am a PhD student at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) supervised by [Paul Wedrich](https://paul.wedrich.at) and member of the [CRC 1624 „Higher structures, moduli spaces and integrability“](https://www.sfb1624.uni-hamburg.de/).

Research Interests
======

I am interested in structural and computational properties of (colored) link homology theories (foremost Khovanov homology), their applications in low-dimensional topology and related topics such as representation theory.
